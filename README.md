Three-Step Method to quantify hysteresis

This file contains hysteresis method MATLAB code of step2 and step3.
The step2 is to calculate lagged correlation coefficients. 
The step3, cross-wavelet analysis is used to get multi-temporal scale lag time, including monthly, annual, and interannual scales.
For cross-wavelet analysis, more details can refer to the developersâ€™ papers (Grinsted et al., 2004).
